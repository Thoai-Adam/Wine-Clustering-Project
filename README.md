# Wine Quality Prediction and Clustering Analysis

## Project Overview
The Wine Quality Prediction and Clustering Analysis project is a data science consultancy endeavor commissioned by the California Wine Institute. The objective of this project is to predict the quality of wine while incorporating unsupervised learning techniques, particularly clustering. We will work with a comprehensive dataset containing information about different wines and their quality ratings. Our primary focus will be on using clustering to gain insights into the data and exploring how clustering can impact the performance of machine learning models in predicting wine quality.

## Project Scenario
As data science consultants, we have been engaged by the California Wine Institute to identify the key factors influencing wine quality. Our target audience is the data science team responsible for data-driven decision-making within the winery supply chain marketing sector. They are particularly interested in understanding the implications of utilizing clustering techniques on the performance of machine learning models. Our findings and insights will be presented in a concise slide deck presentation.

## Project Deliverables
### GitHub Repository:
- **README.md**: This document, including project description, data dictionary, project plan, initial questions, conclusion, and instructions on reproducing the work.
- **final_notebook.ipynb**: A Jupyter notebook containing the entire project pipeline, complete with documentation and code comments.
- **Python modules**: `wrangle.py` (or `acquire.py` and `prepare.py`) for data wrangling and preprocessing.

### Presentation:
- **Slides**: A presentation slide deck comprising an introduction, executive summary, findings, and conclusion. The presentation should not exceed a 5-minute time limit.

## Project Specifications
### Overall
- The final notebook should have thorough documentation explaining the entire process, with code comments as necessary.
- Best practices for data splitting should be followed.
- Data acquisition should be optimized, with caching implemented to store data locally as a CSV file for future data retrieval.
- Data types in the dataset should be appropriate for the data.
- Missing values should be investigated and handled appropriately.
- Outliers should be examined and addressed as needed.

### Exploration
- Explore the interaction between independent variables and the target variable using visualization and statistical testing.
- Utilize clustering techniques to explore the data.
- Employ statistical testing and visualization to assess the usefulness of the clusters.
- Draw clear conclusions from the interactions.
- Experiment with at least three combinations of features for clustering.
- Compare the clusters to the target variable.

### Modeling
- Create a minimum of four different machine learning models.
- Compare the performance of these models.
- Consider one model that incorporates a distinct combination of algorithm, hyperparameters, and features.
- Optionally, explore the creation of models specific to different clusters.

## Guidance
- For the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), prioritize the simplest approach at each stage to make steady progress.
- Implement caching for data storage to optimize data acquisition.
- Model on scaled data and explore on unscaled data.
- Clustering can provide valuable insights and can be used as a feature for modeling.
- It is acceptable to conclude that there is no significant effect or difference if that is the case.
